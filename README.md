### Projects, challenges and clones of beautiful websites using HTML and SASS


These are all my only-HTML/CSS(SASS) (no JavaScript) projects that I have been working on during my self-learning training, they are all mostly challenges from https://www.frontendmentor.io/ and a couple of clones of popular pages, please do not hesitate to ask my anything!

They were first all done with desktop approach and redone to mobile first design, which simplified the overall code, and make it better

I use SCSS and BEM notation

**Have fun!** ðŸš€
